First attempt to create a portfolio.
It features some GSAP animations, use of vue-router and some filtering for the projects part.
Not thinking about mediaqueries atm, it's still a bit responsive, thanks to bootstrap.
Next focus will be on building a more efficent UI, improving graphics and texts.

I've worked with Vite + Vue, Bootstrap, Sass and tried to play around with GSAP.
